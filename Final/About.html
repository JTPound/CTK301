				<p>Im Jack Poundstone, although you probably already knew that from the large page headers. I would consider myself a sound designer who's path has lead me to learn a plethora of other media creation related skills. Containing but not limited to Unity game engine experience, C# experience, JavaScript experience, html and css experience, as well as much more. Although most might be related to making video games, that is not the only type of project I can help bring to life. I was born in Urbana Il, Oct 16 2001. And grew up nearby in the sleepy town of Monticello. I am a soon to be a 2025 graduate of ISU with a bachelors degree in Game Design. Fun facts I like to play soccer, go on hikes, swim, or stay shut in for 15 hours while experimenting with sounds.</p>
